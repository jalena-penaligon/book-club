Veronica Morgan,Ringworld,4,A tale of intrigue... but not in the way it sounds,"The entire time I was reading this book I kept thinking to myself ""what an intriguing concept"". It's just interesting and so very different from most sci-fi books I've read before. The author really handles alien concepts in an alien way. At times you'll relate or understand but more often you just go ""huh... interesting"". I really enjoyed it but it took me a little while to truly get engrossed in it, probably because of how unique and alien the ideas in it are. I highly recommend it just for the experience of it.",20190324114201
Chris Cobb,Ringworld,4,Fabulous!,"Being an engineer by nature, and by training (10 yrs at MIT), when I read this book (in the 1970s) I went supernova. Massive engineering on an unimaginable scale, made real by Niven.",20190309184207
Hattie Le,Ringworld,5,Outstanding book!,"The plot makes sense and the twist in the end is interesting. Niven isn't the best writer out there, but his ideas are outstanding. Hard sci-fi is hard to come by and this one is a classic. Well worth a read. (Now, unfortunately, I cannot say that for the two following novels in the Ringworld saga, but the ""... Of Worlds"" series kinda makes up for it.) I've dreamt of what it would be like to live on the Ringworld; Engineers comes as close as I can think.",20190309124507
Lukas Bentley,The Goliath Stone,5,I enjoyed everything about this book,The banter of the characters managed to include almost every major sci-fi writer. Many times I would just start chuckling when I got the author that had been alluded to in the dialogue. My friends thought I was crazy when they would ask why I was laughing for no reason. That wasn't made easy with when I would have to explain about putting a fish in someone's ear. It is probable that I missed many authors that were alluded to but it was fun just the same. I've been a sci-fi fan for fifty years so this book was like a trip down memory lane. Buy it now as it is worth your time.,20190304132507
Natalia Morton,The Goliath Stone,4,Settle back and enjoy,"There are many references to other Sci-Fi masters and reminds me a bit of Fallen Angels in the tone, and a tribute to Heinlein. Niven writes 'hard science' fiction. Like Fallen Angles, the suspense shouldn't be taken too seriously or you will miss the pokes made about pseudo-science in society. Like Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, just settle back and enjoy the read without trying to peer too deep into meaning.",20190214132507
Lee John,The Goliath Stone,3,Not Niven's best stuff,"This is a quick read about what's become very common—tiny, self-replicating technology. It's full of implausibilities (If they can do that, why not this?) but it's told fast and well with some fascinating characters in a future, scary police-state type world. The problem is that the authors seemed to want to insert every character and crazy ability they've had on their shelves, and it gets to the comic book stage too quickly.",20190104032507
Jasmine Skinner,"I, Robot",5,Robot short stories from the master himself,"Each one in this anthology is groundbreaking and contributed greatly to how robots are depicted today, and indeed may contribute to how we develop ones with current real-world science. The Three Laws are absolute in robot fiction and here's where it all started. Each story shines a new light on the topic while each one is engaging and interesting. Top notch scifi from the man who practically invented the robot story.",20190216073507
Serena Pierce,"I, Robot",3,Fantastic concept for a book,"A series of short stories centered around the impact of the three laws.The details and characters are dated, and anyway, glossed over or not very interesting. The main thing I enjoyed other than the central premise is getting a view into the preoccupations and vices of the 1950s (communism, atomic bombs, smoking, male-centrism) projected into the future. Oh, and he totally failed to predict the rise of China... he has the asians eating from vats!",20190218083607
Josie Orozco,"I, Robot",1,Disappointing,"The premise is that humans create machines that are more perfect than their creators. Somehow the same ethical problems that face humanity are more easily solved by a machine than a human by removing self interest. Sounds a bit like a machine can be successful at implementing Marx’s “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”. I was very disappointed in this book and this author.",20190119093607
Spencer Mcgrath,The Man in the High Castle,3,Slow Read,"I love science fiction, but this alternate history is a slow read. I think I'll give it a second read, now that I have the characters sorted out. If you like PKD, you will probably like this. But if you are looking for an alternative history with some real thought-provoking dialogue and plots, this is SLOW and rather unsatisfying. Is it worth reading? Yes. It plods along but with every page turn you hope something unpredictable will happen. It only gets interesting at the end. You may have a different opinion, and will never know until you read it. I don't regret buying and reading it. It was just a bit disappointing.",20190218103607
Velma Stone,The Man in the High Castle,5,"Not the same story as the TV series, but better","The ending is a mind-twister, and in fact there are discussion groups dedicated to figuring out what it means. I think it was pretty cool, myself. If you've seen the series, this will seem familiar but different. No action East of Laramie, Wyoming, for example. Very few Germans in the story, really. Mostly West Coast and Neutral Zone locales. And some very weird stuff. Including a reference to the late, unlamented, Embarcadero Freeway, which, from the pictures I've seen, really was ugly. This is a fine book, by a fine author, and if you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?"
Oscar Porter,The Man in the High Castle,2,Intriguing but disappointing,"I thought I would enjoy this much more than I did. The premise is intriguing, but I never did care about any of the characters, found some of the plot to be inscrutable and the ending felt like it was written while a courier was impatiently waiting to take the manuscript to the publisher. I know Dick is a remarkable author and this book won awards. I just found it disappointing, as neither the alternate timeline and landscape nor the characters were sufficiently fleshed out for me.",20190319114807
Spencer Mcgrath,2001: a Space Odyssey,5,"Big ideas, strong characters, and a beautifully articulated plot","This is everything the incredible movie was and much more. The book disposes of several mysteries that the film intentionally withholds from the audience, and in my opinion it made for a much more cohesive story. The philosophy and topics in 2001: A Space Odyssey seem to become more relevant as time marches on.",20181231014807
Elsie Rich,2001: a Space Odyssey,4,I was pulled sufficiently along to happily keep turning pages!,"Of course, I'd seen the movie a few times and never quite understood it. The book explained a lot and I enjoyed having the movie fleshed out. Overall, I'd say the telling was sometimes jerky in the moving between scenes. There's really so much to tell and such a fantastical world to describe that an author might be excused from too harsh a critique. Who am I to critique A.C.?",20190111025507
Lydia Mora,Foundation,4,An important work of science fiction,"Isaac Asimov's Foundation is a good start to a great series! Really like the idea of Hari Seldon, the psychohistorian at the heart of the Foundation Series. Even though he largely disappears after the book's beginning, much of the subsequent action is based on his predictions. Seldon predicts the collapse of the 12,000 year galactic empire and what it will take to preserve the knowledge of mankind so that the period of barbarism between civilized life is shortened. That beacon of hope is the Foundation. With his team of mathematicians, Seldon looks at trends and makes predictions about crisis/critical points in history. During this reading, he reminded me of futurists I've been following who tell us about trends and what our world will look like in 20 or 30 or 50 years from now. For Seldon, though, his most consequential predictions are for thousands of years in the future. Seldon's nearly prophetic vision (based on scientific reasoning) made me think of Asimov himself. He was also one of those visionaries (or futurists). His I Robot Series, for instance, envisions human/robot interaction nearly 70 years ago. Asimov also anticipated the ubiquity of personal computers and how the internet could be used for education. Asimov was clearly a visionary! It's no surprise that Foundation is an innovative and engaging space opera that has shaped science fiction since it was published. The downside is that the actual writing isn't great for this first book in the series. It does improve in subsequent books, though. Even though I am dinging Foundation a bit for the writing, it is an important and recommended book which I still enjoyed!",20190222124507
Hattie Le,Foundation,5,Foundational!,"This is where Science Fiction especially Space Opera first started. Any fan of Science Fiction has to read this, this is the father of all Science Fiction. Its why its called Foundation. It is the Foundation of science fiction.",20190304032607
Zainab Harrison,Foundation,3,Slow paced but valuable,This is a very interesting book full politics and intrigue. Actually not a lot really happens but the author provides a lot of food for thought. Some times I felt the writing was just a bit too dry and the characters a bit too bland. Overall however it is a classic piece of science fiction and I am happy I have read it.,20190304032607
Elmer Hahn,Foundation,1,Skip it,"I made it to page 168 then skimmed the rest. Hari Seldon is the know all see all and he, this book, bored the hell out of me. It was chaotic, and my brain was not interested in caring about the Foundation or the Empire. Not For Me.",20190216073507
Serena Pierce,Foundation,1,Not even a story,"I tried to like Asimov and his robots. Really, I did. My friend, who is usually spot-on with his recommendations, would rave and rave about Asimov, this series included. But these stories are so focused on plot, plot, plot, with no effort left over for milieu, character development, or anything else, that I quickly tired of his stories. Each scene plays out more like a math problem than an actual chapter of a story. It's a shame that Asimov is the so-called ""grand master"" of science fiction.",20190228084107
Elsie Rich,Foundation,5,Read it!,"Such fun to re-read. So grand and goofy all at the same time. Pure Asimov. Without his optimism & brio underpinning it, this story wouldn't still work, 50+ years after publication. But it totally does."
Hattie Le,Foundation and Empire,4,One of the all-time great Sci-Fi series,4.5 stars. Part two of the classic Foundation Trilogy. This is class science fiction at its best and is a really fun series to re-visit every now and then. Highly Recommended!! Voted to the Locus Poll of All Time Great Science Fiction Novels.,20190311032607
Veronica Morgan,Foundation and Empire,4,"No surprises, but still entertaining","My first time reading this classic series. I was not surprised at the reveal of the Mule, but enjoyed the story nonetheless.",20190304132507
Josie Orozco,Foundation and Empire,3,A step down from the first book,"Foundation and Empire is sadly not as interesting as the first book in the series. It was hard to get through at times, mostly because of a total lack of suspense, depth and real characters (which is usually also the case in the first book, but that one easily gets extra points because of the brilliance of the ideas). Still, there are many plainly visible influences to be found, and it's good enough that I definitely want to read more of these books.",20190216092707
Spencer Mcgrath,The Time Machine,5,WAY better than the movie!,"First time I have read this book. I remember watching this movie with my Mom as a child and not liking it very much. The old adage rings true here: 'the book is better then the movie!'. It's great to see how those before us figured the future would play out. Usually a 'future' novel, at least in my experience, is placed in the 'near future' up to maybe a few thousand years ahead. Well's takes that equation and does away with it going millions of years ahead. It's a good study (or at least perspective) of where man might be by then. Good read and I encourage anyone who has seen the movie, to read the book!",20190228084107
Elsie Rich,The Time Machine,4,Makes you think,"Read this book for an English class and I thought it was very insightful. It gave very convincing theories on human nature and what possibly could lay ahead of us in the future. to me this book gave the illusion of mystery by not giving some people names. This mystery exemplified the imagery the time travler gave about the future. the ending heightened the mystery seven fold. I was left wanting more, wanting to know more, and wanting to go back to the future with the time traveler. Made me really think about how the time travelers theories are thought out and could potentially actually happen. Definitely a thought invoking read.",20190325172507
Muhammad Trevino,Ubik,4,One of Dick's best,"A very interesting PKD story... I am not a fanatical Dick reader, but this is the best of what I have read. It will make your head swim, but in the end, it actually all ties up (mostly). The dialogue is a bit dated (which can be a little confusing) but it's also incredibly sharp and, at times, it can be laugh-out-loud humorous. Dick's Mojave-dry sense of humor is laced throughout, keeping what could be a pretty bleak story from being pitch black. All in all, a challenging and entertaining read.",20190216073507
Zainab Harrison,Ubik,3,Hard to follow,Interesting concept but a bit too disjointed for me and an unsatisfactory ending after wading through all the details. Just ok not stellar.,20190325172507
Jose Nash,Ubik,3,Not the best writing,"The concepts are really interesting. The writing is pretty utilitarian. I found the story hard to buy into - character's are kinda flat, the dramatic parts didn't pull me in. Might make a good movie.",20190304132507
Vincent Mcconnell,The Fellowship of the Ring,5,A masterpiece,"I read this because my husband is a fan, and now all of our children are as well. Now I can join in all conversations about Middle Earth. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the tale for its own right. JRR Tolkien is a fantastic storyteller and wordsmith. His prose is masterful, and every word powerfully and precisely chosen, if one takes the time to appreciate it. Also, the themes of glorious deeds of valor, patience, mercy, and faithfulness are set brilliantly against a backdrop of awe-ful evil.",20190216092707
Veronica Morgan,The Fellowship of the Ring,5,Loved it!,"I finished this book back in the Fall, and I was truly amazed by Tolkein’s Writing style. I do want to pick it up and read it several more times as it seems like a good book for the cold season. I loved how Bilbo had a split personality with his mother and father’s personalities; one minute he was a Baggins and seconds later he was a Took! My favorite part will always be when Gandalf and the dwarves invade poor Bilbo’s home and ask for various foods and drinks before starting on their big adventure.",20190228084107
Josie Orozco,The Fellowship of the Ring,5,Can't believe I took so long to start reading these,"This is my first time delving into the world of JRR Tolkien. I never watched the LotR trilogy or The Hobbit trilogy as I wanted to read the books first. Well, thus far I'm not disappointed. The books are great. At times I feel like I've only been reading for a few minutes and it's been a few hours. I'm glad I read the books first, because I know how much movies omit and I feel like every situation and character in the books is important.",20190304032607
Zainab Harrison,The Fellowship of the Ring,5,Still fantastic!,"This is at least the 15th time I've read this book and I STILL cannot word my love for everything Tolkien. A day may come when I can actually review my favorite books... ""but it is not this day!",20190304132507
Ellie-Mae Guerra,The Two Towers,5,Better each time I read it,"As this is my third reread of this book, so I'm not going to write a long-winded review, as I think I've said most of what needs to be said about this book in a previous review. This book is still as amazingly beautiful, as the first time I read it. The only thing I am certain of, is that Tolkien's works never tire in your mind, and they somehow become even better, each time you read them. I just love this trilogy."
Elsie Rich,The Two Towers,4,Truly epic,"4.5/5 stars. Once again an amazing book set in an amazing and very creative fantasy world. However, this sequel did drag a bit in some parts, and I had a hard time imagining some of the setting described by the end of the book. Nevertheless, and epic tale that just keeps getting more and more gruesome :)",20190216073507
Serena Pierce,The Two Towers,5,Better than Fellowship,"Amazing! I enjoyed this more than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" which I was surprised about because from what I was told this book is just a long walk. Although that is still true, it was a very exciting walk. Haha. Plus, Gollum is in this one so it is be default better.",20190216073507
Milly Dunlap,The Return of the King,5,Better than the movies,The conclusion to my favorite series of all time. Will Frodo be able to complete his mission? Will such completion cost him his life? Can Middle Earth be saved? Ok. I know. You've seen the wonderful Peter Jackson films. But there is nothing like reading it for yourself. It is the difference in feeling between seeing it on TV and being there. Read the trilogy. Be there. You won't regret it.,20190216092707
Lee John,The Return of the King,5,Tolkein is a master,I love going back and re-reading these books because it makes me appreciate Tolkien for what he accomplished and what he successfully completed. When he first wrote these novels he actually completed the languages first and then derived the stories from the languages he created. No other author will be able to master what Tolkien set out to do.,20190325172507
Lukas Bentley,The Return of the King,5,Perfect,A perfect final volume to an epic adventure. I came to love the characters dearly and was sad to finish the story in many ways. The last chapter in particular was very emotional.,20190304032607
Lydia Mora,The Return of the King,4,Lovely,"The Return of the King takes about a hundred pages to sink one's teeth into, but persevering is worth it for the glint of sunrise on a victorious maiden's hair, for the show of willpower against all odds in the eleventh hour, and for the golden bloom of a happy ending.",20190304132507
Jax Lewis,The Return of the King,4,"Better than the movie, but both are awesome","Even if you love the movie, you should probably read the book anyway. There are a few extra characters tossed in that are actually pretty cool and important (unlike Tom fucking Bombadil), and it's worth it just to say in a superior way that you've read the books. But let's face it - Peter Jackson's version of these books are freaking genius.",20190228084107
Lydia Mora,Inferno,3,A fun sci-fi take on Dante's Inferno,"Very entertaining SF/F revision of Dante's Inferno with Mussolini as guide through the underworld. Written in 1976, this apparently caused quite a stir back then, but many of Niven's fresh ideas have dulled since. Still very creative and imaginative and leaves the reader wondering who is better: Benito Mussolini or a science fiction writer?",20190216073507
Yahya Barrett,Inferno,1,Trash,"Niven and Pournelle rewrite Dante as a pulp SF novel. Well, it would perhaps have been funny as a short story, but as it was I just felt appalled after a while. I wonder which level of Hell they're going end up in for doing this? My guess is the Tenth Bolgia of the Eighth Circle (""various sorts of falsifiers: alchemists, counterfeiters, perjurers, and impersonators""). Any other suggestions?",20190312061207
Savannah Steele,Inferno,1,A letdown,"Maybe it's just me, as I've seen many positive reviews of this book here. But,I think the the writing juvenile,the characters cardboard cutouts. For a story that deals with a trip through Hell,it all seems very lighthearted,almost comic. The horrific punishments don't horrify. For a book that I was really looking forward to,it was a big disappointment. I say pass.",20190302118207
Lee John,The Ganymede Takeover,3,Great for PKD fans,"While this isn't Dick's best work, I really enjoyed it. The first quarter is especially strong, with some great absurdist humor regarding the Ganymedian worms (the worm military leader has the best lines and was my favorite character by far). It's well worth the read, especially if you are a PKD fan.",20190322135207
Abby Robinson,The Ganymede Takeover,3,"Hard to get into, but worth it","Like a lot of Dick books this dives straight into the action from page one, and for the first half of the book the introduction of a lot of characters make it difficult to follow at times. There are some very interesting ideas explored in this story, and it probably needs to be re-read to fully understand everything.",20190325172507
